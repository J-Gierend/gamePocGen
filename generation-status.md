# Game Generation Status - Batch 2 (Gameplay-First)

## Summary
- Batch 1 (10 games) scrapped — all were spreadsheet simulators with no real gameplay
- Batch 2: 3 games generated with rewritten gameplay-first prompts
- Started: 2026-02-06 ~11:02 UTC
- Completed: 2026-02-06 ~12:00 UTC
- Status: ALL 3 COMPLETE - 0 failures!

## Prompt Changes (Batch 2)
- Phase 1: Complete rewrite with concrete examples of good incremental games, anti-patterns, mandatory gameplay tests
- Phase 2: Strengthened gameplay-first messaging, added "Is This Actually A Game?" principle (Principle 9)
- Phase 3/4: Canvas interaction required from Phase 1, game fun test in final verification

## All 3 Games
| # | Job ID | URL | Title | JS Errors | Verified |
|---|--------|-----|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | https://gamedemo1.namjo-games.com | Crystal Mine Defense | None | Loads, grid-based mine area visible |
| 2 | 2 | https://gamedemo2.namjo-games.com | Crystal Cavern Defense | None | Loads, placeable structures (Drill/Turret/Barricade), wave system |
| 3 | 3 | https://gamedemo3.namjo-games.com | Goblin Mine Defense | None | Loads, resource nodes on Canvas, 4 tabs (Build/Upgrades/Skills/Prestige), tower placement |

## Observations
- All 3 games have concrete gameplay-themed titles (no more "Echo Chamber" or "Signal Lost")
- All 3 have placeable structures on Canvas (actual tower defense gameplay!)
- Game 3 has the most complete feature set: 4 tabs, skill tree, prestige, wave system
- 0% failure rate (vs ~30% in Batch 1) — prompt quality improvements may have helped
- Games lean heavily toward mine/defense theme — may want more genre variety in next batch

## Batch 1 (Scrapped)
All 10 games deleted. They were:
- Echo Loom, Signal Lost, Echo Chamber x3, Echo Garden x2, Gravwell Orchard, The Crossing, Fragments of Alexandria
- Problem: All were "number incrementors with sprites" — no real gameplay, no player interaction with Canvas
